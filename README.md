Lantern-Veil - Unity Version: 6.2 (6000.2.7f2)

Lantern-Veil is a first-person fantasy combat game set in a dark, medieval-inspired world where light and magic shape the battlefield. For our class project, we developed a fully playable Arena Mode focused on fast-paced combat, spellcasting, and survival. Players fight waves of enemies using a sword, Fire spells, and potions they pick up throughout the arena. The game features responsive combat feedback, visual damage effects, a working inventory system, and an atmospheric environment designed to create tension and immersion.

While our original plan included a full story mode and a narrative-driven campaign, we shifted development toward polishing core mechanics, enemy encounters, player abilities, UI systems, and overall gameplay feel. The Arena Mode represents the best pieces of our systems working together: combat, traversal, pickups, progression elements, and player feedback effects all built in Unity.
